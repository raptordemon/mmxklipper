Here is an example of an A to A cable:

**You must block off the 5v pin** on the cable or there will be damage to the Pi or The MMX mainboard.

## About the firmware
This is very much an alpha test and requires Klipper and GUI to be working on a Raspberry Pi or equivalent. If you have not tried klipper before; do not attempt this.  
The MMX uses a mcu STM32F407ZET6 192k ram 512k cache 168mhz with a custom boot loader, so modifications to the klipper code were needed to make the binary.  
Klipper was configured to use STM32f407 MCU 64k bootloader offset 8mhz clock and usb pa11/pa12 (USB-A) as the config options.  
The usb c port is on other pins and more work is needed to get it functional. There is also usart 3 that needs further testing.  
USB C is on pb14/pb15 but we have not been able to make it work

Its far from ready but here is whats working and whats not:

**Working**
X&Y movement and homing  
Z motion and homing  
Extruder & hotend  
Heated bed  
Independent dual Z with Z tilt  
Filament Runout  
NeoPixels  
Probe  

**Not Working:**  
TBD  

**Not Tested:**  
SDcard  
Usb C port  
Touchscreen (mine is missing) 
GD board

**Needed:**  
Optimize movement  
Bed Mesh  
Macros  

## Installation
To upload the firmware download the specific bin file and the cfg. Rename the bin to firmware.bin and put it on the sd card. Then upload the printer.cfg and macros.cfg to your klipper instance
